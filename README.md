# Pizza Store - MVC

**Description:** 
- We created a Pizza Store application in MVC wherein we added different functionalities for both the ADMIN and the USERS.

**Functionality**
- Add new customer through SignUp
  - Taking inputs from the user and updating it in the database.
- Login if user already has the account
  - Check the user with their unique ID.
- Check individual order history of a user.
  - Record of all their previous and recent pizza orders.
- Check total order placed for a particular store.
  - Admin can check order history of a particular store.
- On the basis of number of pizza's sold, the quantity of pizza will get decreased from the inventory.
- If a user orders a pizza, their order history gets stored in their Order History section with all the details of the previously ordered Pizza.
- Total Bill for a user is calculated based on the pizza, size and the topping they choose.
- We added a profile section wherein user can change their details like email, zipcode, name etc, and the changes will be reflected in the databaase.
- Admin can check all the users who have access to their Pizza Store once they logged in.

**Summary**  
When we run the application, we come to the default Index page where we can't access any other section as we are not logged in.
There are two options, to sign up or to login.
We land on the home page where we will see some of the pizza with their details and image, user can click on the order button to order a pizza.
Successfully ordering pizza will then generate a bill and that order will get added to the user's order history.
